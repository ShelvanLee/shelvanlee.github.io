## Xifan Li 

I'm a Ph.D candidate in [University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/), supervised by [Dr. Xue Zhang](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/engineering/staff/xue-zhang/).  My research areas includes neural network, consititutive model and DEM. Prior to my Ph.D. program, I was working on civil engineering materials supervised by [Prof. Xiaodi Hu](http://cea.wit.edu.cn/info/1141/3952.htm) and [Assoc. Prof. Pan Pan](http://cea.wit.edu.cn/info/1141/3941.htm) in [Wuhan Institute of Technology](https://www.wit.edu.cn/).

My research interests include <b>Neural Networks</b>, <b>Deep Learning</b>, <b>Pavement Engineering</b>, <b>Pavement Materials</b> and <b>Structural Health Monitoring</b>. I am eagerly in applying <b>Reccurent Neural Networks</b> to the feild of engineering, like history-dependent materials conctitutive models.
